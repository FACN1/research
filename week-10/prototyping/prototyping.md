# Prototyping

### What is prototyping?
**Proof of concept of a website/app**

- A prototype is a simulated version of a section or all of the website.
- Set of pages which may be partially interactive.
- Part of the testing purpose.
  - Can be used for getting client or customer feedback before actually coding/implementing features.
- It lets you find out:
  - if the idea works as expected
  - does the flow of the website work the same as originally planned?
  - is it solving the problem that it should solve?

### Example of a prototype:
#### App Idea

- Cloud image storage and organisation app

#### App Flow

##### Flow - First Time Used
+ [ ] When opening the app, you are given a welcome message
+ [ ] Then directed to add your first gallery
+ [ ] After clicking through to add a new gallery, you need to fill in a form, then upload your image to the app.
+ [ ] You are then directed back to flow 2.

##### Flow - Used Before
+ [ ] If you have used the app before, you will see a list of galleries when you open it.
+ [ ] You can click on a gallery to see a grid of the images in it.
+ [ ] If you click on an image, you will see the entire image on the app screen

##### At any time
+ [ ] You can click the menu button to see the menu which will direct you to other parts of the app such as settings.


#### How to prototype this?
There are a number of programs or sites that can be used to prototype a site. You can also prototype on paper by drawing a number of wireframes, then switch between pieces of paper while interacting with the pages/wireframes to test the user flow. There are even apps to scan paper wireframes and turn them into mobile phone prototypes.

##### List of prototyping tools:
- Adobe Experience Design - Windows/Mac app - will be paid once out of beta
- Invision - Online/web app - free for one app per account
- Sketch - Mac only
- Prototyping on Paper - Phone app - Free but in app purchases
