# Prototyping tools

### What on earth are they!?

They are, unsurprisingly, tools with which to build software prototypes.

### Ok... what are software prototypes?

From wikipedia:

> [which] simulate key aspects of the final product, while ignoring others (like textual and media content, interactivity, real implementation)

So software prototypes allow you to see a how the app might work - this might look completely different to the final app, and typically only simulates a few aspects of it.

### So is it like a more developed wireframe?

Yes, in a way - in fact lets look at the differences between the two:

#### Wireframes

Wireframes are purely visual representations of a site/app. It most simply used to show where elements appear on the app. It can vary in detail - from just blocks taking up space that represent things (say a profile picture or description), to actual images and texts.

Wireframes **are not** interactive - the moment they become clickable and show animations or whatever, they become...

#### Prototypes

So, like I say, a prototype can almost be thought of as an interactive wireframe - a basic prototype is often called a clickable wireframe. That is, you can click on a button on a wireframe, and it will take you to another wireframe (in the way that in the app, clicking that button will take you to another webpage/endpoint).

### So why use them?

Wireframes generally should be a lot quicker, cheaper and easier to be made, and allow developers to focus on the big picture.

Prototypes generally have more fidelity (i.e. detail) and can allow for some user testing. They should give a realistic *idea* of the final product.

Both have several other benefits. It allows everyone to make sure they are on the same page before any hard coding is done - if a prototype is shown to a stakeholder or client and it is completely different to what they want/need, that problem can be resolved.

They help the development team, the clients, and the stakeholders visually understand the proposed interactions and solutions to the problem.

#### Understanding

Both wireframing, and prototype facilitate understanding and communication between the client, the developer, and other stakeholders. It helps developers create more user-centred products, by ensuring what they are planning is addresing the user journey effectively.

Working all these things out prior to coding saves on time (and money) consuming mistakes and misunderstandings - they open lines of communication between developers and stakeholders.
