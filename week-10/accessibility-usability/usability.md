### UX vs. UI
- UI: how the website looks
- UX: how it feels to use the website

### Usability & UX Design
- How a user _feels_ when using the website is key - we want to avoid frustration, and make interaction satisfying, effective and efficient
- We want to create an interface that doesn't make the user think any more than necessary - it should be intuitive
- Could also be framed as complexity vs. simplicity

### Examples

##### Example 1
![Example 1](ex1.jpg)
- Left = BAD
  - Too many options in one big layout
- Right = GOOD
  - Options consolidated into one interaction

##### Example 2
![Example 2](ex2.jpg)
- Left = GOOD
  - Only the most relevant inputs are presented to the user - they're clear and easy to understand
  - An option to alter how the results are displayed is only offered after the search has been made
- Right = BAD
  - Includes inputs not required until after the search has been made
  - Unnecessary questions separating the form into sections

##### Example 3
![Example 3](ex3.jpg)
- Left = BAD
  - Price and product rating not prominent enough
  - Buttons too close together for mobile
  - Tab bar at bottom of screen decreases viewing area
- Right = GOOD
  - Price and product rating are clearly visible, and associated with the action `ADD TO CART`
  - Interface layout is clean - the content dominates the screen
  - Buttons are appropriately spaced for mobile

##### Example 4
![Example 4](ex4.jpg)
- Left = BAD
  - Page content is quite long, and covers a diverse set of page goals
  - No clear next action or direction for the user
- Right = GOOD
  - Only one primary goal / call to action on the page
  - Content is organised in more logical format - clear buttons for each different new page
