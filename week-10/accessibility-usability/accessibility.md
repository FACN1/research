## What is Web Accessibility?
Web accessibility means that people with **disabilities**`(visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological)` can use the Web in terms of:
- perception
- understanding
- navigating
- interacting
- contributing

#### Why is this important?
- `Millions` of people have disabilities that affect their use of the Web.
- Currently `most` Web sites/software `have accessibility barriers` that make it difficult or impossible for many people with disabilities to use the Web or contribute to it.
- even users who are not disabled have `different needs`, preferences, and situations(eg a slow Internet connection)
- even people who are not disabled may have `"temporary disabilities"` (eg broken arm), or `changing abilities` due to aging.
- for more benefits(including benefits for organizations) see the document "Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization"




#### How to make it accessible?
An international standard for Web accessibility exists! (O_O). It's called the "Web Accessibility Initiative"(WAI) its role is to develop guidelines and techniques that describe accessibility solutions for Web software and Web developers.

#### What to use to make it accessible?
- `Web browsers, media players, and other "user agents";` for more information, see [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/uaag.php).
- `Authoring tools that creates Web sites;` for more information see, [Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/atag.php).
- `Evaluation tools that determine if a Web site meets standards and guidelines;` for a list of accessibility evaluation tools, see [Evaluation, Repair, and Transformation Tools for Web Content Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/).
- People with disabilities sometimes use other software, called assistive technologies, to interact with the Web! (O_O)


#### Is it hard to make it accessible?
Making a Web site accessible can be simple or complex, depending on many factors such as the type of content, the size and complexity of the site, and the development tools and environment.
##### But still...Do it quick, do it NOW!
`Many` accessibility features are `easily implemented` if they are `planned from the beginning` of Web site development/redesign.
Fixing inaccessible Web sites can require **significant effort**, especially sites that were not originally "coded" properly with standard XHTML markup, and sites with certain types of content such as multimedia.

For more, see the document "Implementation Plan for Web Accessibility" lists basic steps for addressing accessibility in Web projects.


`AccessLint Rubygem by Cameron Cundiff`
Run web accessibility audits on urls or files, from the command line or within Ruby. AccessLint uses Google's Accessibility Developer Tools javascript library to make assertions on the DOM via PhantomJS.
`AccessLint.com` is a hosted version of the AccessLint Rubygem
