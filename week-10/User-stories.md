### User Journeys and User Stories

###### what is the difference between Journey and a Story?
#### User Stories:
- A User story is:
  - a tool to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective.
  -  describes the type of user, what they want and why.
    - As a <role>, I want <feature> so that <reason>.
helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.
- User stories should be written in a non-technical manner from the perspective of an end user
- Avoiding too many user stories:
  - In time sensitive projects, the overuse of user stories can become a common waste of time. If there are potentially too many user stories:
    - try delineating how user stories will and will not contribute to building and realizing business goals and objectives and deliver value to stakeholders.
- Who is responsible for writing user stories?
  - Ultimately the business owner is responsible for writing user stories, but it should be a collaborative effort between stakeholders / biz owners and developers.
  - Some tech companies find it most effective to have the stakeholder describe a feature, and have a designer wireframe the feature (http://balsamiq.com can be used for this), while a project manager can compose story cards in Pivotal Tracker (http://pivotaltracker.com) and then we can all see/read the stories and discuss the priority/level of work involved.

#### User journeys:
A user journey is a path (typically 4-12 steps) a user may take to reach their goal when using a particular website. User journeys are used in designing websites to identify the different ways to enable the user to achieve their goal as quickly and easily as possible. its used for tow main things:

 * Demonstrating the way users currently interact with the product
 * Demonstrating the way users could interact with the product

Why -
* To visualise the user requirements and help feed into other design activities such as information architecture.
* Demonstrating the vision for the project
* help us understand user behavior -how users are going to interact with your system and what they expect from it.
* help identify possible functionality at a high level
* help you define your interface

###### How a User Story is Different from a User Journey

**User Story** is based on a specific feature, which supports a broader **user journey** whereas a **User Journey** describes the process the user goes through from the beginning to the end of his use of the app.

**Note: Based on context, a User Journey and Story can be one and the same**

#### What is the Job to be Done?

 ###### How do I create a user journey?
If you have already done personas then congratulations, you already have a lot of the input you need to create a user journey. Before attempting a user journey you should understand:

* Your user’s goals
* Their motivations
* Their current pain points
* Their overall character
* The main tasks they want to achieve

###### How is detail added to user stories?
DETAIL CAN BE ADDED TO USER STORIES IN TWO WAYS:
* By splitting a user story into multiple, smaller user stories.
* By adding “conditions of satisfaction.”

When a relatively large story is split into multiple, smaller agile user stories, it is natural to assume that detail has been added. After all, more has been written.
