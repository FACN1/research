# BlanketJS - Research Afternoon

## What is it?

## Why is it helpful?
While other tools require additional build steps (like instrumenting the code into a separate folder),
BlanketJS integrates with Node's require() to instrument JavaScript code on the fly.
Ideally, there are tests that cover every part of the code. For some projects, it’s easy to tell when this is the case. But if you find yourself writing tests for a complex piece of code that didn’t have many or any tests beforehand, then it can be good to know exactly how much of the code is being tested and which bits still need to be exercised through tests. And this is when a code coverage tool is needed.
