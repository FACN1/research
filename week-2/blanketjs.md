# BlanketJS - Research Afternoon

---

## What is it?

BlanketJS is a seamless test coverage tool for JavaScript / Node that integrates with QUnit and outputs the
coverage information directly on the page containing the test results.

In seamless test we simply mean that whatever change is being applied to a system, happens without and negative impact resulting from the integration. It is often used in the context of software and system development as well as for computer hardware


  - what is test coverage?

  is a measure - in percentage- to describe how many lines of the code are executed while testing.
  A higher code coverage has a lower chance of containing undetected software bugs compared with low code coverage

## Why is it helpful?

While other tools require additional build steps (like instrumenting the code into a separate folder),
BlanketJS integrates with Node's require() to instrument JavaScript code on the fly.
Ideally, there are tests that cover every part of the code. For some projects, it’s easy to tell when this is the case. But if you find yourself writing tests for a complex piece of code that didn’t have many or any tests beforehand, then it can be good to know exactly how much of the code is being tested and which bits still need to be exercised through tests. And this is when a code coverage tool is needed.
