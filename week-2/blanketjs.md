## What is it?

BlanketJS is a seamless test coverage tool for JavaScript / Node that integrates with QUnit and outputs the
coverage information directly on the page containing the test results.

In seamless test we simply mean that whatever change is being applied to a system, happens without and negative impact resulting from the integration. It is often used in the context of software and system development as well as for computer hardware


  - what is test coverage?

  is a measure - in percentage- to describe how many lines of the code are executed while testing.
  A higher code coverage has a lower chance of containing undetected software bugs compared with low code coverage
