# Unit vs Integration Testing

### Unit Testing
- Used to test relatively small pieces / units of code
- The tests should be narrow in scope, and easy to write and execute
- They should be pure - outside dependencies are "mocked" or "stubbed out"
- Written by and for the programmer to identify bugs early in the development cycle

### Integration Testing
- Larger scale tests, carried out to demonstrate that different pieces of the system work together
- Might cover the whole application, but can also be used for smaller scale tests, for example anything that uses a resource like a database or queue
- Ususally carried out by a test team _after_ unit testing and _before_ system testing
