### what does mock mean?
- mocking is creating objects that simulate the behavior of real objects.


### why would you mock a database ?
- because the database its slow object you have to create the database before the test. Tests will run faster with a mock database.

- mock database its more simple than the real database

### does this help with testing?
- it makes the testing more easy because you deal  with fake database .
- its recommended to use the unit test when we deal with database.
- when we use the a unit test, mock objects can simulate the behavior of complex, real objects and are therefore useful when a real object is impractical or impossible to incorporate into a unit test.
