## Cookies & Caching

#### what cookies are ?
 Cookies are small files which are stored
 on a user's computer, They are designed to hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular client and website, and can be accessed either by the web server or the client computer.

 This allows the server to deliver a page tailored to a particular user, or the page itself can contain some script which is aware of the data in the cookie and so is able to carry information from one visit to the website (or related site) to the next.

#### how they can be used to remember stateful information ?

* Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":

  * When a user visits a web page, his name can be stored in a cookie.

  * Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his name.
